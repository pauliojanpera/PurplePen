Places that may need updating for multi-part courses:

DONE: Need to have data model and XML model for specials on a single part, descriptions on a single part

DONE: Data and XML model for print area on a single part.

DONE: QueryEvent.FindClosestLeg -- take a part?
DONE: AddControlMode.GetControlInsertionPoint -- return SelectionDescription instead of course id?
DONE: Controller.GetCurrentPrintArea -- should handle print area for just active part.
DONE: Controller.EndSetPrintArea -- should set print area just for active part? Is this an option?
DONE: Controller.BeginAddDescriptionMode -- handle adding description for a single part.
DONE: AddControlMode -- take CourseDesignator instead of CourseId?
DONE: CourseView.CreateFilteredAllControlsView -- take course designators instead of course ids?

DONE: Specials -- support specials in a single part.

DONE: Look at references to CourseView.BaseCourseId -- should they be CourseDesignators instead?

DONE: All parts course view should not include descriptions from each part.

DONE: Select which courses for descriptions should include all controls.

DONE: Print courses should have option to print all parts together, or separate (the default). Enable only
if there are any courses with multiple parts.

DONE: Prohibit adding map exchange to score course.

DONE: Description text for part of a course.

XML export with map exchanges. Need to look at what other programs do.

DONE: Status text when adding map exchange -- 3 options: existing map exchange, new map exchange, map exchange at control

Allow adding start or finish to course part that shouldn't include that? Should that switch to all parts? Or just prohibit that if not on the right part.

Removing map exchange at a control -- how? Have menu item for this? Or maybe people just have to remove and re-add the control?

Adding control to part when last control of part is selected doesn't work well.

Have event audit section for missing control descriptions on maps.

Test for printing courses, punch card and descriptions.

Tests for adding map exchange in AddControlModeTests

Consider getting map exchanges working for score courses also.
