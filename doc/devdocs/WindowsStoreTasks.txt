Things to deal with for Windows Store packaging:

DONE Help file - build needs to put help file in the correct place. 

DONFonts - need to install fonts; requires manifest and contacting support. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions#fonts
DONE Redirect existing shortcuts - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions
DONE File associations - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/integrate-packaged-app-with-file-explorer
  -- Prog Id redirection doesn't seem to work, but implemented anyway. 
DONE Uninstall previous version - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-distribute

CODED/UNTESTED Notify users when new version is available: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/store-developer-package-update
DONE Disable current auto-update and use this instead.

Install fonts via installer when exporting.

Non-store version should direct people to store version if on Windows 10 of late enough version and an update is available.
