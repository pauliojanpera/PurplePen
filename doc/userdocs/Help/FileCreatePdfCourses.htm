<h1>File/Create PDFs/Courses...</h1>

<p>Creates PDF file(s) for later viewing or printing. By default, the 
entire map will be placed in the PDF. To chose the area that will be printed, the paper size, and the paper orientation, use the
<a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">File/Set Print Area</a> command.</p>
    <p>Using this command is preferable to using the Print Courses command and a PDF printer driver for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The resulting PDF will typically be smaller in size.</li>
        <li>The resulting PDF will use vector graphics for higher quality printing.</li>
        <li>The resulting PDF will use (if the default is retained), the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black color model.</li>
        <li>There are less likely to be problems resulting from printer driver bugs.</li>
        <li>If the base map file is a PDF file, the PDF from that file will be copied directly into the output, yielding as high a quality as the original PDF.</li>
        <li>If desired, each course can be placed in its own PDF file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In some cases, using this command and printing the resulting PDFs may produce better output than directly using the Print Courses command, depending on your specific printer.</p>

<img alt="Print Courses Dialog" src="CreatePdfs.png"></p>
<p>This dialog has several options to customize how PDF files are created.</p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>
    This section shows which courses will be
    printed. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be
    printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
    <strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all
    of the checkboxes at once. If you are printing a course with variations, click on the course name (not just the checkbox), select <a href="ChooseVariations.htm">Choose Variations...</a> to select how to print the variations.
</p>
<h2>Files sections</h2>
    <p><strong>Name prefix</strong>: If something is typed in here, it is 
prefixed onto the file name of each PDF file. For example, if you type 
&quot;Final&quot; in this box, then the result files would be &quot;Final-Course 1.pdf&quot;, 
&quot;Final-Course 2.pdf&quot;, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Files</strong>: Indicates how multiple maps are packaged into PDF files. The choices are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One for all courses</strong>. A single PDF file is created with all courses in it, one page per course. The name of the PDF is the name of the event.</li>
        <li><strong>One per course</strong>. Each course is placed in its own PDF file. The name of the PDF is the name of the course. If a course has a map exchange, the PDF file will contains multiple pages, one for each part.</li>
        <li><strong>One per course part</strong>. Each course is placed in its own PDF file .The name of the PDF is the name of the course. If a course has a map exchange, each part of the course is placed in its own PDF file, with &quot;-1&quot;, &quot;-2&quot;, etc added to the file name.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Appearance section</h2>
<p>Several things are set in this area:</p>
    <p><strong>Print area too large</strong>: This setting determines what happens if the <a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">
print area</a> is too large to fit on a single sheet of paper. <strong>Crop to a single 
page</strong> (the default) will pick the portion of the map that best covers that 
course. <strong>Print on multiple pages</strong> will print multiple pages of maps to cover the 
entire print area. Note: if the base map file is a PDF map, you cannot change this option.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Print Map Exchanges on Same Map</strong>: This setting only appears if a map exchange is present in the event. If this is checked, all parts of the course are printed together, overlapping. If unchecked, a separate map is printed for each part of the course. Typically this should be left unchecked unless you want to see all parts together for some reason.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;<strong>Color Model</strong>: Determines how the colors on the map are stored inside the PDF file:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RGB</strong>: Translates the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black colors in the map to Red-Green-Blue colors using a simple formula. The colors on the printer will typically not match the intended colors exactly. This is the method used by versions of Purple Pen prior to 2.0.</li>
        <li><strong>CMYK</strong>: The default. Outputs the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black colors to the PDF file. This generally produces the most accurate rendition of the intended colors.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Folder section</h2>
<p>This section determines in which folder (directory) the course files are 
created. There are three choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Same folder as Purple Pen file</strong>. The files are placed in 
	the same folder as the Purple Pen (.ppen) file for this event. This is the 
	default choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Same folder as map file</strong>. The files are placed in the 
	same folder as the map file for this event.</li>
	<li><strong>Other folder. </strong>Any other folder. If you chose this, a 
	&quot;Select Folder...&quot; button appears which you can click to select any folder.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Create</strong>: This button creates the PDFs. If this would cause files to be overwritten, a list of those files is displayed. The dialog box closes.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without doing anything.</p>
