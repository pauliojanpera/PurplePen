<H1>Moving around the map</H1>
<H2>Panning the map</H2>
<p>There are three ways to pan around the map to see parts that are off the edge of the display window.</p>
<UL>
<LI>Use the scroll bars on the right and bottom edges of the map windows to move the map around.</LI>
<LI>Press and hold either the left or right mouse button, and drag the map around.</LI>
	<LI>Press the arrow keys on the keyboard.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Zooming in and out</H2>
<p>There are three ways to zoom the map in and out. The current zoom level is always displayed at the bottom right of the main window, just to the left of the zoom slider.</p>
<UL>
<LI>Use the <a href="ViewZoom.htm">View/Zoom menu item</a> to select a zoom level.</LI>
<LI>Drag the zoom slider, located at the bottom right of the main window.</LI>
<LI>Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. When using the mouse wheel, the map will zoom around the point where the mouse pointer is.</LI>
</UL>
<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<p>There are two shortcut commands that can be useful:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="ViewEntireMap.htm">View/Entire Map</a> command positions 
	and zooms the main window to view the entire map.</li>
	<li>The <a href="ViewEntireCourse.htm">View/Entire Course</a> command 
	positions and zooms the main window to view all the controls on the current 
	course.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Experienced users find that using the mouse wheel to zoom is often the easiest way to move long distances around the map. Zoom out until the area you wish to view is visible, then move the mouse to that location and zoom in.
