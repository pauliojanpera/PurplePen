<h1>File/Create PDFs/Descriptions...</h1>
</div>
<p>The Create PDFs/Descriptions command creates a PDF with control description sheets for one 
or more courses.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Create PDFs/Descriptions Dialog" src="CreatePdfsDescriptions.png"></p>
<p>This dialog has several options to customize the result of the created PDF.</p>
<h2>Output section</h2>
<p>This section shows the paper size and 
orientation, and the margins. Click <strong>Change Margins</strong> to change the paper 
size, orientation, or margins.</p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>
    This section shows which courses will have their control description sheets
    printed. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be
    printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
    <strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all
    of the checkboxes at once. If you are printing a course with variations, click on the course name (not just the checkbox), select <a href="ChooseVariations.htm">Choose Variations...</a> to select how to print the variations.
</p>
<h2>Copies section</h2>
<p>This section determines how many copies of each description sheet will be 
printed. There are three options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>one copy of each course</strong>. With this option, one 
	description will be printed for each course, with different courses being 
	placed on the same sheet of paper. The program will attempt to arrange the 
	control descriptions so that as few sheets of paper as possible will be 
	used.</li>
	<li><strong>one page of each course</strong>. With the option, one <em>page</em> 
	of descriptions will be printed for each course. As many copies of the same 
	course&#39;s description will be placed on each page as will fit. </li>
	<li><strong>multiple pages of each course</strong>. With this option, you 
	can chose how many descriptions to print for each course. The program will 
	print as many pages as needed of each description to reach the requested 
	number. The program will not mix different descriptions on the same page.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose &quot;multiple pages of each course&quot;, enter the number of copies of 
each description (not the number of pages) in the text box below. For example, 
if you enter 50 descriptions per course, and the program can fit 10 descriptions 
on each page, 5 pages of 10 descriptions each will be printed for that course. 
If another course can only fit 6 description on each page, then 9 pages of 6 
descriptions each will be printed for that course.</p>
<h2>Appearance section</h2>
<p>The section determines how the descriptions appear. </p>
<p><strong>Line size</strong>: The height of each line in the description sheet. 
Since the boxes in a description sheet are square, this also determines the 
width of boxes. The IOF recommends a size between 5mm and 7mm, but any size 
between 3 and 10mm may be specified.</p>
<p><strong>Description type:</strong> The type of description sheet to use. The 
possible options are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Symbols</strong>: the standard IOF symbolic description sheet, 
	with 8 columns and symbols used to describe controls.</li>
	<li><strong>Text</strong>: instead of symbols, an English language textual 
	description of the control is used. The textual description fills the area 
	normally occupied by the last 6 columns of the description. The textual 
	description is automatically generated.</li>
	<li><strong>Symbols and Text</strong>: The IOF symbols, with text 
	equivalents to the right. The textual description for each control is 
	automatically generated.</li>
</li>
	<li><strong>Course Default</strong>: Whichever of Symbols, Text, and Symbols 
	and Text is specified in the <a href="CourseProperties.htm">course 
	properties</a> for the course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Create PDF</strong>: This button creates the PDF file. The dialog box closes,
and you are prompted for where to save the PDF file.</p>
<p><strong>Preview: </strong>Opens a print preview dialog box that shows what 
will be in the created PDF. </p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without doing anything.</p>
