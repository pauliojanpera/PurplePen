<h1>Course/Properties...</h1>
<p>Change the properties of the current course. (If the All Controls map is 
displayed, then the <a href="AllControlsProperties.htm">All Controls Properties 
dialog</a> is displayed instead.)</p>
<p><img src="CourseProperties.png"></p>
<p>The following properties can be changed:</p>
<p><b>Course name:</b> The name of the course. This name is displayed in the first box of the header row of the description sheet. The name should generally be short.</p>
<p><b>Course Type:</b> The type of course. Allowable types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal course: A normal orienteering course with a fixed order of controls.</li>
<li>Score course: A score-O or freestyle orienteering course, with no fixed order of controls. No lines are drawn between the controls, and no length is computed. Optionally, a score can be associated with each control.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Climb:</b> The climb, in meters, on the course. If left blank, no climb is displayed on the description sheet.</p>
<p><b>Length</b>: The length of the course, in kilometers. Typically, this is set to &quot;Automatic&quot; (or blank), so that the length of the course is automatically calculated. If an number is entered, that length is used on the control description instead of the calculated value.</p>
<p>
	<b>Do not include in reports</b>:
    When checked, this course will not be included in reports. Additionally, the course will not be listed when showing which courses a control or leg is used in. 
	Typically, this is checked for courses that are not intended to be used in the event, but are used for experimental purposes, to plan control set out or pickup, or show 
	details of the area for other reasons.
</p>  
<p><b>Class list/secondary title:</b> The text entered here is displayed on the second line of the description sheet, below the event title and about the course name, length and climb. This line is often used to list the competitor classes using the course, but this line can be used for alternate course-specific information if needed. 
When using this line to specify competitor classes, separate the class names 
with commas, so that they are exported correctly to IOF XML format.</p>
<p><b>Map printing scale:</b> The scale that the course is to be printed at. Setting this correctly is important, because it affects the size of the control circles on the map, as well as the actual printed scale. Note that different courses can be printed at different scales (e.g., Brown at 1:10,000 and Blue at 1:15,000).</p>
<p><b>Description appearance:</b> Controls how control description sheets appears. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Symbols</strong>: the standard IOF symbolic description sheet, 
	with 8 columns and symbols used to describe controls.</li>
	<li><strong>Text</strong>: instead of symbols, an English language textual 
	description of the control is used. The textual description fills the area 
	normally occupied by the last 6 columns of the description. The textual 
	description is automatically generated.</li>
	<li><strong>Symbols and Text</strong>: The IOF symbols, with text 
	equivalents to the right. The textual description for each control is 
	automatically generated.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Control circle labels: </b>Controls how the labels on the control circles 
are display. The default setting is the usual form using the sequence number of 
the control (1, 2, 3, ...). Other options include the control code, or both the 
sequence number and the code (e.g., "3-145"), as commonly used in mountain bike 
orienteering. In a score course, you can also use sequence and score, or code 
and score.</p>
<p><b>First control number:</b> The number given to the first control. This is typically 1, so that the course is numbered 1, 2, 3, .... If you set it to, for example, 7, 
then the controls in the course will be numbered 7, 8, 9, .... This can be used to handle multi-part courses, map exchanges, or other special cases. 
However, a better way to handle map exchanges or multi-part courses is to insert 
a map exchange directly.</p>
<p><strong>Show points in:</strong> (available for score courses only) Controls 
which column of the description sheet the point value for each control is 
displayed in: column A, B, H, or not displayed.</p>
