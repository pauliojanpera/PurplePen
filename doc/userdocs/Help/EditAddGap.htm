<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This command only appears when a leg or control is selected.</p>
<p>Adds a gap to a leg or control circle, so as not to obscure an important map 
feature.</p>
<h2>Adding a gap to a control circle</h2>
<p>It is recommended to <a href="Moving%20around.htm">zoom in</a> on the desired 
control circle first. Select the desired control circle, then chose the Edit/Add 
Gap command. </p>
<p>Either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click on the portion of the control circle that you wish to remove. A 
	small section of the control circle will be removed around where you 
	clicked. The size of the created gap is always the same. </li>
	<li>Press and hold the left mouse button where you would like the gap to 
	begin. With the mouse button still held down, drag the mouse to where you 
	would like the gap to end, and then release the mouse button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a gap in a control circle is created, its size can be adjusted by 
dragging the end points of the gap with the mouse.</p>
<p>If different courses are printed at different scales, the control circles 
will be different. Each different print scale will have its own set of gaps.</p>
<h2>Adding a gap to a leg</h2>
<p>Selected the desired leg, then chose the Edit/Add Gap command. </p>
<p>Either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click on the portion of the leg that you wish to remove. A small section 
	of the leg will be removed around where you clicked. The size of the created 
	gap is always the same. </li>
	<li>Press and hold 
the left mouse button where you would like the gap to begin. With the mouse 
button still held down, drag the mouse to where you would like the gap to end, 
then release the mouse button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a gap in a leg is created, its size can be adjusted by dragging the end 
points of the gap with the mouse.&nbsp;</p>
