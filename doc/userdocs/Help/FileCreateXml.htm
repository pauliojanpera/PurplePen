<h1>File/Create Data Interchange File (IOF XML)</h1>
<p>This command creates an XML Interchange File that contains information about 
all of the courses and controls in the event. This file can then be used in 
electronic punching programs and event administration programs, to avoid having 
to reenter course information manually. The file that is created contains 
information about all the courses in the event.</p>
<p>There are two different IOF interchange formats that are not compatible. Be sure
to use the version that your application requires. Use the "Save as type" list to 
select the format you wish.</p>
<p><a href="http://orienteering.org/resources/it/data-standard-2-0/">IOF XML version 2.0.3</a> is the older version of the standard,
created in 2002. It is the most widely accepted form, but has some ambiguities and missing features.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://orienteering.org/resources/it/data-standard-3-0/">IOF XML version 3.0</a> is the new version of the standard,
        created in 2012. It improves on the older standard, and is gaining use, but is still not as widely accepted.
