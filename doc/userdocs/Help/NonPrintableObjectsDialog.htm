<h1>Map File Cannot Be Printed Accurately</h1>
<p>This dialog appears when printing courses, if the OCAD map file for this 
event contains symbols that Purple Pen cannot draw or print accurately. If this 
dialog appears, the map will not print exactly as the map designer intended. A 
list of which symbols will not appear correctly appears in the dialog. After 
reviewing the list of symbols that will not print correctly, you may wish to 
continue printing, or to cancel.</p>
<p>Assuming you have OCAD installed on your computer, you can
<a href="FileCreateOcadFiles.htm">export the courses to OCAD</a> and print from 
OCAD, in order to have the maps print exactly as intended.</p>
<p>You can review the <a href="UnsupportedSymbols.htm">list of symbol options 
that do not draw or print correctly</a>.</p>
