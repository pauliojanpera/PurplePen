<h1>View/Map Intensity</h1>
<p>Sets the intensity with which colors in the map are displayed. There are five different settings: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Full. When set to Full, the map is displayed with all colors at their normal, full intensity. The other settings make the colors of the map less intense to various degrees, which makes the purple course overprinting easier to see.</p>
<p>The default intensity is Medium.</p>
