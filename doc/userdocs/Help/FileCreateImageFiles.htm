    <h1>File/Create Image Files...</h1>

    <p>
        This command creates an image (bitmap) file for each course that you specify. This can
        be useful for displaying a course on a web site, or for further editing in a paint program.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each course chosen, an image file with the name of that course will be created, using the
        print area defined for that course.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Create Image Files Dialog" src="CreateImageFiles.png">
    </p>
    <p>This dialog has several options to customize the result.</p>
    <h2>Courses section</h2>
    <p>
        This section shows which courses will have image files created. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be
        printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
        <strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all
        of the checkboxes at once. If you are exporting a course with variations, click on the course name (not just the checkbox), select <a href="ChooseVariations.htm">Choose Variations...</a> to select how to export the variations.
    </p>
    <p>For each course, an image file with the name of the course is created.</p>
    <h2>Output section</h2>
    <p><strong>File format</strong>: This shows which file format will be used; either PNG, JPEG, or GIF. </p>
    <p>
        <strong>DPI</strong>: This number of dots per inch in the bitmap. The higher the number, the more detail is shown,
        and the larger the image file will be.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Color Model</strong>: Determines how the colors on the map are converted into colors on the printer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RGB</strong>: Translates the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black colors in the map to Red-Green-Blue colors using a simple formula. The colors in the image will typically not match the intended colors exactly.</li>
        <li><strong>CMYK</strong>: The default. Keeps the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black colors as true as possible, using a standard color profile of CMYK colors. This generally produces the most accurate rendition of the intended colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>World file:</strong> This is enabled if the base map file is an OCAD or OOM file with real world coordinates defined.
        Set this to Yes to create a .PGW, .JGW, or .GFW world file that defines the relationship between the image
        file and the real world coordinate system.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>File name prefix</strong>: If something is typed in here, it is
        prefixed onto the file name of each output file. For example, if you type
        &quot;Final&quot; in this box, then the result files would be &quot;Final-White.png&quot;,
        &quot;Final-Yellow.png&quot;, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Folder section</h2>
    <p>
        This section determines in which folder (directory) the course files are
        created. There are three choices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Same folder as Purple Pen file</strong>. The files are placed in
            the same folder as the Purple Pen (.ppen) file for this event. This is the
            default choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Same folder as map file</strong>. The files are placed in the
            same folder as the map (.ocd/.xmap/.omap) file for this event.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Other folder. </strong>Any other folder. If you chose this, a
            &quot;Select Folder...&quot; button appears which you can click to select any folder.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other buttons</h2>
    <p><strong>Create</strong>: This button Creates the image files. The dialog box closes.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without creating anything.</p>
