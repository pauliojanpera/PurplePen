<h1>Add/Map Exchange/Flagged Route to Map Exchange</h1>
<p>Adds a map exchange at a location that is not a control point. There is a flagged route from the last control on one part to the map exchange location, which serves as the start for the second part. The map exchange point appears as a triangle.</p>
<p>When this command is selected, any existing map exchange locations are shown in light purple on the current course map.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To add an existing map exchange location to the current course, click on the light purple triangle.</li>
<li>To add a new map exchange point to the current course, click elsewhere on the map. </li>
</ul>


    <p>Once you have added a map exchange, <a href="UsingMapExchanges.htm">the editing window allows switching between parts of the course</a>.</p>
