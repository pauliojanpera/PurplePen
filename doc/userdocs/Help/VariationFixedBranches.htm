    <h1>Leg Assignments</h1>
    <p>The Leg Assignments dialog allows assigning specific legs to specific branches of a forked course. Each fork is displayed in a matching color. </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have a forked relay with 5 legs like the following:</p>
    <p><img src="LegAssignments2.png" /></p>
    <p>If you want the last leg of the relay to have all competitors on fork E, place "5" next to leg "E", as follows:</p>
    <p><img src="LegAssignments1.png" /></p>
    <p>Legs A, B, C, and D, will be distributed randomly, since they were not assigned to a specific leg, giving variations like the following:</p>
    <p><img src="LegAssignments3.png" /></p>
    <p>You can assign more than one leg to a fork by typing multiple leg numbers, separated by commas.</p>
    <p>See <a href="Variations.htm">more information on variations</a>.</p>
