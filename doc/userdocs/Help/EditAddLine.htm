<h1>Add/Line</h1>
<p>Adds a special item that is a series of line segments. The color and appearance of the line is customizable. This can be used for various special purpose courses or training events, or for extra decoration on the map.</p>
<p>First, you customize the appearance of the lines:</p>
<p><img alt="Add Line Dialog" src="AddLineDialog.png"></p>

    <p>You can customize the appearance of the lines on the map as follows. A preview of the selected options appears in the &quot;Sample&quot; box, next to a control circle (for scale).</p>
    <ul>
    <p><strong>Color:</strong> Select the color of the line. You can select one of the predefined colors from the list. 
        If you select &quot;Purple&quot;, the color of the line will match the purple color used for the 
        rest of the course (which can be set through the <a href="EventCustomizeCourseAppearance.htm">Customize Appearance</a> command.)</p>
    <p><strong>Change Color:</strong> If you wish to select a color other than the predefined colors in the list, click this button and choose the amount of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black in the color that you want.</p>
        <p><strong>Style</strong>: Select the style of line: single, double, or dashed.</p>
        <p><strong>Width</strong>: Enter the width of the line in mm. For a double line, this indicates the width of each of the two lines.</p>
        <p><strong>Gap Size</strong>: For the style &quot;double&quot;, enter the width gap between the two halfs of the double line. For the style &quot;dashed&quot;, enter the length of a gap between dashes.</p>
        <p><strong>Dash Size</strong>: For the style &quot;dashed&quot;, enter the length of each dash.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        After clicking &quot;OK&quot;, draw the lines on the map with the mouse as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Press and hold the left mouse button at the location where the line should begin.</li>
        <li>Move the mouse to where the first corner should appear, and release the mouse button.</li>
        <li>Press and hold the left mouse button again to draw the next line segment.</li>
        <li>Move the mouse to where the next corner should appear, and release the mouse button.</li>
        <li>After releasing the mouse button at the end of the line, click the mouse once to finish drawing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By default, the lines appear on all courses. If you wish it to appear only on some courses, use the <a href="EditChangeDisplayedCourses.htm">Item/Change Displayed Courses</a> command.
