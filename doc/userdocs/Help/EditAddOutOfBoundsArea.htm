<h1>Add/Out Of Bounds Area  </h1>
<p>Draws an area that is forbidden for competitors to enter. </p>
<p>If the out-of-bounds area does not have a natural boundary on the map, it may be useful to mark the boundary with an <a href="EditAddUncrossableBoundary.htm">uncrossable boundary</a>. </p>
<p>Draw the area on the map with the mouse as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the left mouse button at the location where the one corner of the area should be.</li>
<li>Move the mouse to where the next corner should appear, and release the mouse button.</li>
<li>Press and hold the left mouse button again to draw the next side of the area.</li>
<li>Move the mouse to where the next corner should appear, and release the mouse button.</li>
<li>After releasing the mouse button at the last corner, click the mouse once to finish drawing.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the out-of-bounds area special item appears on all courses. If you wish it to appear only on some courses, use the 
<a href="EditChangeDisplayedCourses.htm">Item/Change Displayed Courses</a> command.
