<h1>Add/Timed Start</h1>
<p>Adds a the point at which timing begins to the beginning of a course, when it is
different from the start triangle. This indicates the spot 
before the start triangle where timing begins. The start triangle indicates where navigation begins.
</p>
<p>
The timed start is connected to the start triangle with a dashed line. The
distance between the timed start and the start is included in the calculated
length of the course. 
</p>
<p>
    To have the dashed line from the timed start to the start follow a
    particular path, select that path and then use the <a href="EditAddBend.htm">Item/Add Bend</a> command
    to add bending points to the line.
</p>

<p>The point at which the map is given to the competitor can either be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At the timed start.</li>
    <li>At the start triangle.</li>
    <li>Along the path from the timed start to the start triangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be asked which of these three options to use when adding the timed start.</p>
<p>If the map is given to the competitor before the start triangle, that point
is marked with a small cross line.</p>
