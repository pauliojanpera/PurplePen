<h1>Moving Shared Control</h1>
<p>
    This appears when moving a control in a course that is shared with at least one other course. It never appears 
    when moving a control in the "All Controls" display. Choose one of the options.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Move Control In All Courses</b>. The control is moved, and all courses that use that control change. This was the
    standard behavior in Purple Pen prior to version 2.5, when this dialog was introduced.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Create New Control In This Course</b>. The existing control stays where it is, so that other courses will
    not change. A new control withe a new code is created where you moved the control to, which replaces the existing control
    is the current course. The result is that the control is moved in this course (and has a new code), but all other
    courses are unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Do Nothing</b>. The moving of the control is cancelled, and it stays where it was.
