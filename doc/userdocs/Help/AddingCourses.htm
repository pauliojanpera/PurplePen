<h1>Adding courses</h1>
<p>After the event is created, the Purple Pen <a href="PurplePenWindow.htm">main 
window</a> appears, with the map displayed. At this point, it&#39;s usually best to 
begin by creating the set of courses that your event will use. You can always 
add or remove courses later, if you need to, but it helps to have the initial 
set of courses created.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="CourseAddCourse.htm">Course/Add Course</a> command once for 
each course that you need, and enter the name of the course. You don&#39;t need to 
worry about the other fields in the Add Course dialog now. Once you&#39;ve added all 
the courses, they will appear in tabs across the tab of the window in the
<a href="CourseTabs.htm">course tabs</a>. Click on a tab to display and work on 
that course.</p>
