<h1>Reports/Control Cross-reference</h1>
<p>The Control Cross-reference report provides a convenient, compact summary of 
all the controls in the event and which courses they are used in. Each row of 
the report corresponds to a particular control. Each column shows a course. If a 
control is present on a given course, the intersection of the row for the 
control and column for the course shows which control number the control is on 
the course. For example, if the row labeled &quot;35&quot; and the column labeled &quot;Orange&quot; 
intersect with the number 3, then the third control on the Orange course is the 
control with code 35. </p>
<p>This report is useful to print and have in-hand on the day of the event. If 
there is a problem with a control, this report easily shows which courses are 
affected. If you want to begin picking up controls after some courses have 
finished, you can quickly determine which controls are no longer needed. </p>
<p>To print the report, click the <strong>Print</strong> button. To view a preview of the printed 
report, or to adjust margins, text size, headers and footers, or paper 
orientation, click the <strong>Print Preview</strong> button.</p>
<p>To copy all or part of the report to the clipboard, select the portion of the 
report you wish to copy. Then click the right mouse button on the selected text, 
and select Copy from the menu.</p>
