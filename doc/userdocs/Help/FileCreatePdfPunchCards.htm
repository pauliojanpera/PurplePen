    <h1>File/Create PDFs/Punch Cards...</h1>

<p>This command creates a PDF file with master punch cards for one or more courses. The punch patterns for controls should be entered by using the
<a href="ControlsPunchPatterns.htm">Controls/Punch Patterns</a> command.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Print Punch Cards Dialog" src="CreatePdfsPunchCards.png"></p>
<p>This dialog has several options to customize the result.</p>
<h2>Output section</h2>
<p>This section shows the paper size and 
orientation, and the margins. Click <strong>Change Margins</strong> to change the paper 
size, orientation, or margins.</p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>
    This section shows which courses will have their control description sheets
    printed. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be
    printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
    <strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all
    of the checkboxes at once. If you are printing a course with variations, click on the course name (not just the checkbox), select <a href="ChooseVariations.htm">Choose Variations...</a> to select how to print the variations.
</p>
<h2>Copies section</h2>
<p>This section determines how many copies of each punch card will be printed. A 
new page is started before printing each additional copy of the punch cards.</p>
<h2>Appearance section</h2>
<p>The section determines how the punch cards appear. </p>
<p><strong>Punch box size</strong>: enter the side of each square in the punch 
card. The default size of 18mm generally works well, but you may wish to adjust 
the size to fit your paper or exactly match the punch cards you are using.</p>
<p><strong>Punch card layout</strong>: click this to set the the
<a href="PunchCardLayout.htm">layout of the boxes on the punch card</a>.</p>
<h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Create PDF</strong>: The dialog closes, and you are prompted for where to save the PDF file.</p>
<p><strong>Preview: </strong>Opens a print preview dialog box that shows what 
will be placed in the PDF file. </p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without doing anything.</p>
