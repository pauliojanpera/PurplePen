<h1>Selecting objects</h1>
<p>In order to perform many operations in Purple Pen, you must first select the object that you wish to work on. There are three general types of objects you can select.</p>
<h2>Selecting a control, start, or finish</h2>
<p>There are two ways to select a control, start, or finish.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the control circle in the <a href="MapDisplay.htm">map display</a>.</li>
<li>Clicking on the control line in the <a href="ControlDescriptionsPane.htm">
control description pane</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a control, start, or finish is selected, the control circle is displayed in red, and the corresponding control description line is highlighted in yellow. The 
<a href="SelectedObjectPane.htm">selected object description pane</a> shows the control code, location, and which courses use that control.</p>
<h2>Selecting a leg</h2>
<p>To select a leg, click on the line representing the leg in the 
<a href="MapDisplay.htm">map display</a>.</p>
<p>When a leg is selected, it is displayed in red. The 
<a href="SelectedObjectPane.htm">selected object description pane</a> shows the length of the leg, and which courses use that leg.</p>
<h2>Selecting a special item</h2>
<p>Click in the map on a special item such as a first aid location, out-of-bounds area, or control description block to select it.</p> 
<p>When a special object is selected, it is displayed in red. The 
<a href="SelectedObjectPane.htm">selected object description pane</a> shows which courses display that special item.
<h2>Moving selected items</h2>
<p>To move an item, it must first be selected. Once it is selected, most items 
can be moved by holding the mouse down on them and dragging them to a new 
position. Control numbers or codes can be repositioned by moving them also. Once 
a control number is moved, it will always stay in that location. To make a 
control number be automatically positioned again, drag it onto the control 
circle.<p>&nbsp;<p><a href="Home.htm">Return to: Getting Started</a><!-- #EndEditable --><p>&nbsp;
