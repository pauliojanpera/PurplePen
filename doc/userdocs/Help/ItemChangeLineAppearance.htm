<h1>Item/Change Line Appearance...</h1>

    <p>You can customize the appearance of the lines on the map as follows. A preview of the selected options appears in the &quot;Sample&quot; box, next to a control circle (for scale).</p>
    <ul>
    <p><strong>Color:</strong> Select the color of the line. You can select one of the predefined colors from the list. 
        If you select &quot;Purple&quot;, the color of the line will match the purple color used for the 
        rest of the course (which can be set through the <a href="EventCustomizeCourseAppearance.htm">Customize Appearance</a> command.)</p>

        <p><strong>Style</strong>: Select the style of line: single, double, or dashed.</p>
