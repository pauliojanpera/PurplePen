<h1>File/New Event</h1>
<p>Creates a new event, replacing the current event. If the current event has changes, you will be asked if you wish to save them first. 
The command will ask all the questions involved in creating a new event, exactly 
as if you had chosen to create a new event from the first window.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Only one event can be open at a time within Purple Pen. If you wish to view two events at once, you must start a second copy of Purple Pen.</p>
