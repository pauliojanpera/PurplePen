<h1>Initial course design</h1>
<p>After creating the courses, it is often a good idea to try out some rough 
plans for each of the courses. Pick a course to design first, and click on the
<a href="CourseTabs.htm">tab</a> for that course to view it. Since you haven&#39;t 
designed anything yet, you will just see the map. First, place the start 
triangle by clicking the <a href="EditAddStart.htm">Add Start</a> button on the 
toolbar, then clicking on the map where you want the start. Similarly, click the
<a href="EditAddFinish.htm">Add Finish</a> button and click to place the finish.</p>
<p>Next, use the <a href="EditAddControl.htm">Add Control</a> button on the 
toolbar (or press Ctrl+A) to place each control. When placing a control, note 
that it will go immediately after the currently <a href="Selecting.htm">selected</a> 
control, or in between the currently selected leg. As you place controls, Purple 
Pen will automatically assign control codes and they will show up in the
<a href="ControlDescriptionsPane.htm">description sheet pane</a> on the left 
side. As you initially design courses, it is easiest to not worry about control 
descriptions or control codes until later. If you need to,
<a href="Moving%20around.htm">zoom in and out or move around the map</a>&nbsp; 
to see the map and control placements more carefully. Note that Purple Pen 
automatically calculates the length of the course as you add controls; keep an 
eye on this to get your course around the right length.</p>
<p>Once you are more or less happy with the first course, move on the next by 
selecting a new tab. As you design the second course, you will note a few small 
differences. Firstly, the start and finish are automatically placed for you. You 
can add additional starts and finishes if you want, but in most cases you will 
want to use a single start and finish for all courses. Secondly, when you add a 
course, all the existing controls in the event show up in light purple. If you 
want to use an existing control, you can just click on it. In this way it is 
easy to share controls between courses.</p>
