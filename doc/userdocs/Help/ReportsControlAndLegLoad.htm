<h1>Reports/Control and Leg Load</h1>
<p>The Control and Leg Load report shows how many courses and competitors are 
using each control and leg on the course. Use this report to identify controls 
and legs that may have too many courses or competitors on them. The competitor 
load for controls and legs is only shown if the number of competitors on each 
course has been set using the <a href="CourseCompetitorLoad.htm">
Course/Competitor Load</a> command. </p>
<p>The report has two sections. The Control Load section shows every control in 
the event, the number of courses using that control, and the total competitor 
load for that control. The list is sorted by competitor load, with the highest 
load listed first.</p>
<p>The Leg Load section shows all legs in the event that are used by more than 
one course. For each such leg, the controls at the beginning and end of the leg 
are shown, along with the number of courses using that leg, and the total 
competitor load for that leg. Note that a leg run in one direction from control 
A to control B is considered different than a leg run in the reverse direction 
from control B to control A.</p>
