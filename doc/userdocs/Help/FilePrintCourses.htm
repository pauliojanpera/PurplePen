<h1>File/Print Courses...</h1>

<p>Prints the courses and underlying map onto a printer. By default, the 
entire map will be printed. To chose the area that will be printed, use the
<a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">File/Set Print Area</a> command.</p>
<p>Note: Purple Pen prints almost all OCAD map symbols exactly as OCAD would 
print them. If Purple Pen encounters a <a href="UnsupportedSymbols.htm">symbol 
in the OCAD map that it cannot print correctly</a>, then it will display a 
dialog listing the symbols that will be printed correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img alt="Print Courses Dialog" src="PrintCourses.png" ></p>
<p>This dialog has several options to customize the result of printing.</p>
<h2>Output section</h2>
<p>This section shows which printer will be used. Click <strong>Change Printer</strong> to change which printer to use. The paper size and orientation should be set using the <a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">File/Set Print Area</a> command.</p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>
    This section shows which courses will be
    printed. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be
    printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
    <strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all
    of the checkboxes at once. If you are printing a course with variations, click on the course name (not just the checkbox), select <a href="ChooseVariations.htm">Choose Variations...</a> to select how to print the variations.
</p>
<h2>Copies section</h2>
<p><strong>Copies of each course:</strong> How many copies of each course will be printed. </p>
    <p><strong>Pause printing after each course or part</strong>: If this is checked, then printing will be paused after each course, or part of a course (for courses with a map exchange). This can be useful, for example, to retrieve paper from the printer, feed special paper for different courses, or to flip paper for two sided printing.</p>
<h2>Appearance section</h2>
<p>Several things are set in this area:</p>
    <p><strong>Print area too large</strong>: This setting determines what happens if the <a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">
print area</a> is too large to fit on a single sheet of paper. Crop to a single 
page (the default) will pick the portion of the map that best covers that 
course. Print on multiple pages will print multiple pages of maps to cover the 
entire print area.</p>
    <p><strong>Color Model</strong>: Determines how the colors on the map are converted into colors on the printer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OCAD Compatible</strong>: Picks the color model based on how OCAD does: the CMYK color model for PostScript and PDF printers, and the RGB color model for other printers. This setting should match OCAD behavior very closely.</li>
        <li><strong>RGB</strong>: Translates the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black colors in the map to Red-Green-Blue colors using a simple formula. The colors on the printer will typically not match the intended colors exactly. This is the method used by versions of Purple Pen prior to 2.0.</li>
        <li><strong>CMYK</strong>: The default. Keeps the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black colors as true as possible, using a standard color profile of CMYK colors. This generally produces the most accurate rendition of the intended colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Print Map Exchanges on Same Map</strong>: This setting only appears if a map exchange is present in the event. If this is checked, all parts of the course are printed together, overlapping. If unchecked, a separate map is printed for each part of the course. Typically this should be left unchecked unless you want to see all parts together for some reason.
    </p>
<h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Print</strong>: This button prints the courses on the selected 
printer. The dialog box closes.</p>
<p><strong>Preview: </strong>Opens a print preview dialog box that shows what 
will be printed. </p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without printing anything.</p>
