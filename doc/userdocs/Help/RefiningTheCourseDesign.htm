<h1>Refining the course designs</h1>
<p>After you finish the initial design of the courses, you will want to spend 
time refining the design until the courses are exactly the way you want them. 
Usually there will be an initial refinement, following by field work checking 
the control locations, followed by additional refinement after the field work. 
Several features of Purple Pen can make this process efficient.</p>
<ul>
	<li>As you move or delete controls, all courses that share that control are 
	immediate updated. You can easily see the effect of any change, or
	<a href="EditUndo.htm">undo</a> it if it is not to your liking.</li>
	<li>You can quickly see the set of all controls in the event by clicking on 
	the <a href="CourseTabs.htm">All Controls tab</a>. This allows you to see if 
	you have too many controls, and easily identify places where controls could 
	be shared between courses. You can also <a href="FilePrintCourses.htm">print</a> 
	an all controls map for field work.</li>
	<li>While designing a course, you can view all the other controls in the 
	event by using <a href="ViewAllControls.htm">View/All Controls</a>. This 
	allows you to easily identify places where controls could be shared between 
	courses.</li>
	<li>The <a href="ReportsControlAndLegLoad.htm">Control and Leg Load report</a> 
	allows you to check if some controls or legs have too many competitors.</li>
	<li>One your have finalized control locations, you can entire the 
	description for each control by simply clicking in the appropriate box in 
	the <a href="ControlDescriptionsPane.htm">control description pane</a>.</li>
</ul>
