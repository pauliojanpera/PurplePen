<h1>Course/Competitor Load</h1>
<p>The Course/Competitor Load command sets the expected number of competitors 
who will be running on each course. </p>
<p>
<img alt="Course Load Dialog Box" src="Course%20Load.png" width="369" height="362">&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set the expected number of competitors for each course, click in the right 
column next to each course and type the number of expected competitors.</p>
<p>Setting the number of competitors is useful, because it allows Purple Pen to 
calculate the expected number of competitors using each control and leg, taking 
into account shared controls and legs. This number is called the <em>load</em> 
for a control or leg. Once you have used the Competitor Load command, the load 
for a control or leg is displayed in the <a href="SelectedObjectPane.htm">
selected object pane</a> when a control or leg is selected. You can get a report 
on the load for all controls and legs using the
<a href="ReportsControlAndLegLoad.htm">Reports/Control and Leg Load</a> command.</p>
