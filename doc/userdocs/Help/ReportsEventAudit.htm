<h1>Reports/Event Audit</h1>
<p>The Event Audit report checks the event for a number of different kinds of 
potential problems, and reports any that are found. The Event Audit consists of 
a number of sections. If no problems are found for a given section, that section 
is omitted. The sections are as follows:</p>
<h2>Missing Items in Courses</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reports any course without a start triangle.</li>
	<li>Reports any normal course without a finish circle.</li>
	<li>Reports any normal course without a climb amount.</li>
	<li>If some courses have <a href="CourseCompetitorLoad.htm">competitor loads</a> 
	defined, reports any course without a competitor load.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Close Together Controls</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reports any pair of controls closer than 100m apart.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unused Controls</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reports all controls, starts, finishes, and mandatory crossing points 
	that are in the All Controls collection, but not used in any course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Missing Description Boxes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reports any control with no main symbol in column D.</li>
	<li>Reports any controls using the &quot;crossing&quot;, &quot;junction&quot;, or &quot;between&quot; 
	symbols that does not have a symbol in both columns D and E.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Missing Points</h2>
