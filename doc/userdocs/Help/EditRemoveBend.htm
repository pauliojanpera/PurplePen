<h1>Item/Remove Bend</h1>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This command is available only when a leg with bends in it, 
or when a out-of-bounds area, dangerous area, or uncrossable boundary is 
selected.</p>
<p>If a leg has a bend in it (created with the <a href="EditAddBend.htm">Item/Add Bend</a> command), this command is used to remove it. After selecting the Remove Bend command, click the mouse on the bend you would like to remove.</p>
<p>This command is also used to removes a corner from a special item such as a dangerous area or uncrossable 
boundary. After choosing the Remove Corner command, click the mouse on the 
corner you would like to remove. A dangerous area or out-of-bounds area must have at least three corners, so 
you cannot remove a corner from a special area that has only three corners.</p>
