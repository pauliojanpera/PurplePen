<h1>Item/Leg Flagging</h1>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This command only appears when a leg is selected.</p>
<p>This command sets whether a leg is flagged with tape. The following options are available: </p>
<ul>
<li><B>No flagging. </B>This is the normal state for a leg&mdash;no flagging tape is present.</li>
<li><B>Entire leg flagged. </B>Use this state when the entire leg is flagged. This is often used for the leg to the finish, or for a leg on a beginner course which is too difficult to navigate without flagging. The leg is displayed with a dashed purple line, and the control description sheet displays the flagging. 
If the flagging is not along a&nbsp; straight line, <a href="EditAddBend.htm">add 
bends</a> to the leg to mark the actual path of the flagging.</li>
<li><B>Beginning of leg flagged. </B>Use this state when the first part of the leg is flagged leading out of the control. The portion of the leg that is flagged is displayed with a dashed purple line, and the control description sheet displays the length of the flagged portion of the leg.</li>
<li><B>End of leg flagged. </B>Use this state when only the end of the leg, leading into the control, is flagged. This is typically only used for the last leg to the finish, but it is allowed to be used on any leg if you so desire. The flagged portion leg is displayed with a dashed purple line.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a leg is partially flagged, a bend is added to the leg. Reposition this bend by dragging it with the mouse in order to show the actual location where the flagging ends.</p>
