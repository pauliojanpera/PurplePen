<h1>Events, Courses, and Controls</h1>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>An <em>event</em> consists of one or more orienteering courses that are being 
held on the same map, usually on a single day. The Purple Pen program always 
deals with a single event at a time. The name of the event appears on the first 
line of every control description sheet. All the information about an event is 
stored in a single file with the &quot;.ppen&quot; file extension. Usually the file name 
is the same as the event name.</p>
<p>If you need to see two events at once, you must start two separate copies of 
Purple Pen.</p>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>An orienteering event will have one or more courses that are being held on 
the same map. After creating an event, usually the next step is to create the 
courses with the <a href="CourseAddCourse.htm">Course/Add Course</a> command. 
The set of courses in an event are always listed in the <a href="CourseTabs.htm">
course tabs</a> along the top of the window. </p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Each course consists of several controls (plus a start and finish). Controls 
are often shared between courses, so Purple Pen maintains a &quot;control collection&quot; 
consisting of all controls for the entire event. The control collection can be 
views by selecting the &quot;All Controls&quot; <a href="CourseTabs.htm">course tab</a> at 
the top left of the window. It is possible for a control to be in the control 
collection but not (yet) present in any course.</p>
<p>The description and code for a control is set only once, no matter how many 
courses the control is present in. If you change the description or code of a 
control, it changes in all courses at once.</p>
<p>Starts, finishes, and mandatory crossing points are treated much like 
controls, and are shared between courses and present in the control collection 
as well. Only control have an associated code, however.</p>
