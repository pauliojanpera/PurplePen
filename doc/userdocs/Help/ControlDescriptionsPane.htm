<h1>Control Descriptions Pane</h1>
<p>The control descriptions pane is located in the left part of the main window. 
The size of the control descriptions pane can be adjusted by using the mouse to 
drag the border that separates it from the map display. If the entire control 
description is not shown, use the scroll bar to move it up or down.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Control Descriptions Pane" src="ControlDescriptionsPane.png" width="260" height="324"></p>
<p>The control description pane displays the control descriptions for the 
current course. If the <a href="CourseTabs.htm">&quot;all controls&quot; tab</a> is 
selected, the control descriptions for all controls in the event are displayed. 
The <a href="Selecting.htm">selected control</a> (if any) is highlighted in 
yellow.</p>
<p>The descriptions for a control are changed directly using the control 
description pane. Click once anywhere in a control description line to select 
the control and highlight the line. Once a control is selected, click again on a 
box within the highlighted line to change the contents of the box. A pop-up menu 
appears with all possible symbols for that box. To remove the symbol from a box, 
selected the last item in the menu (it appears as a large square). </p>
<p>Textual items, such as the feature dimensions, are entered by clicking on 
them, then typing into the pop-up edit box and pressing Enter. The event title, 
secondary title, and course climb can also be edited directly by clicking twice 
in the corresponding box.</p>
