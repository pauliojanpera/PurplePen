<p>Adds an existing control from the control collection to the current course, or creates a new control and adds it to the current course. The position of the new control in the current course is chosen as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a control (or the start) is selected, the new control is placed immediately following that control.</li>
<li>If a leg is selected, the new control is placed between the two controls that make up that leg.</li>
<li>If nothing is selected, the new control is placed between the two control 
closest to the new control.</li>
</ul>
<p>When this command is selected, all the controls in the control collection that are not already in the current course are shown in light purple on the current course map.</p>
<ul>
<li>To add an existing control to the current course, click on the light purple existing control.</li>
<li>To add a new control to the current course, click elsewhere on the map. The new control is created with a code selected according to the <a href="ControlsAutomaticNumbering.htm">automatic numbering</a> settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the "All controls" map is displayed, the newly created control is only added to the control collection, but not to any course.</p>
