<h1>Missing Fonts Dialog</h1>
<p>
<img alt="Missing Fonts Dialog Box" src="MissingFonts.png" width="446" height="349"></p>
<p>When first creating an event, opening an event, or changing a map file, 
Purple Pen loads the the map file associated with that event. Each text symbol 
in the map file describes that font that the text object uses. In order to 
correctly display the text, the font must be installed in Windows. If an OCAD 
map file uses fonts that are not installed on the computer, Purple Pen displays 
this dialog listing which fonts are used by the map, but not installed on the 
current computer.</p>
<p>When displaying or printing the map, Purple Pen will use the &quot;Arial&quot; font 
instead of the font used by the map (OCAD does the same thing). This will cause 
text objects to display differently than the map designer intended. In most 
cases, this doesn&#39;t cause significant problems, but it could cause text to 
overlap the map, be too large or small, or otherwise be a problem. </p>
<p>To make the text objects display with the correct font, you must obtain the 
font file listed and install them using the Windows control panel. </p>
<p>If you check the &quot;<strong>Don&#39;t warn about missing fonts for this event again</strong>&quot; 
check box, Purple Pen will not display this dialog again the next time the event 
is loaded. Otherwise, Purple Pen displays this dialog each time an event that 
uses a map with missing fonts is loaded.</p>
