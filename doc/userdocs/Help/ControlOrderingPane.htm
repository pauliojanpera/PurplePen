<h1>Control Ordering Pane</h1>
<p>The control ordering pane is located in the left part of the main window. It is
displayed when you press the "Ordering" button on the <a href="OrderingSwitch.htm">descriptions/ordering switch</a>.
The size of the pane can be adjusted by using the mouse to 
drag the border that separates it from the map display. If the entire course is not shown, 
use the scroll bar to move it up or down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The control ordering pane displays the control codes for the current course,
in the order that they will be visited, from top to bottom. It is primarily useful
for courses with <a href="Variations.htm">variations</a> but can be used for any course.
</p>
<p>The <a href="Selecting.htm">selected control</a> (if any) is highlighted in 
red.</p>
<p>You can click on a control code to select that control, or a line to select
the leg between two controls.</p>
<p>A red arrow on the control ordering pane will show where a newly created control
will be inserted.</p>
<p>You can press the left mouse button down on a control code, keep the mouse button
held down, and drag the control code to a new location in the course. This provides an
easy way to rearrange controls or move them between branches and loops.</p>
<p>Letters in light gray next to branches show the letter associated with that branch, which
are used to identify different variations of the course.
