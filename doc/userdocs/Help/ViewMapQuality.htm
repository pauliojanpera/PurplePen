<h1>View/Map Quality</h1>
<p>Sets the quality with which lines in the map are displayed. There are two different settings: Low and High. In high quality, lines in the map are smoothed to display more realistically (sometimes called "anti-aliased"). In low quality, lines are displayed in a more jagged fashion, but the map is drawn somewhat more quickly.</p>
<p>The default quality is High.</p>
