    <h1>Installing Purple Pen 3.5.0 and later</h1>
    <h2>Purple Pen is no longer digitally signed</h2>
    <p>
        Starting with Purple Pen 3.5.0, the Purple Pen installer is no longer signed with a code signing certificate. The 
        prices of code signing certificates have increased dramatically, and it is no longer cost-effective to purchase one
        for Purple Pen. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of this, a Windows feature called "SmartScreen" may warn you that the installer is dangerous.
        The following instructions will help you install Purple Pen.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also bypass all of this trouble by installing via the Microsoft Store instead.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation warnings</h2>
    <p>You may see the following warning when running the installer:</p>
    <p><img src="install1.png"  /></p>
    <p>Click the text "More Info"</p>
    <p><img src="install2.png" /> </p>
    <p>Click the button "Run Anyway".</p>
    <h2>Additional instructions for Microsoft Edge</h2>
    <p>If you use Microsoft Edge to download the installer, you may also see messages when downloading the installer.</p>
    <p><img src="edge1.png" /></p>
    <p>Click the "..." next to the message (NOT the one next to the title Downloads) (the "..." may not be visible until you move your mouse over the message).</p>
    <p><img src="edge2.png" /></p>
    <p>On the menu that appears when you click "...", click "Keep".</p>
