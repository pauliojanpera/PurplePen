<h1>Translating the User Interface</h1>
<p>Purple Pen uses a web-based service called LaunchPad to translate the user 
interface. LaunchPad allows many people to collaborate on translating pieces of 
text in the program. You must create a free account on LaunchPad to contribute 
translations. Once a translation is mostly complete, the next version of Purple 
Pen will incorporate it.</p>
<h2>Getting a LaunchPad account</h2>
<p>First, go to the <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/purple-pen">
LaunchPad translation page for Purple Pen</a>:</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screen 1" src="screen1.png" width="782" height="644" class="style1" /></p>
<p>Click on the &quot;Log in / Register&quot; link, and follow the instructions to create 
a new account. </p>
<h2>Selecting languages</h2>
<p>Once you have completed getting a new account and finished 
logging in, click the ling &quot;Select Languages...&quot; link inside the &quot;Your 
languages&quot; box. From the very very long list of languages presented, select the 
language(s) you would like to translate Purple Pen into, and click Save.</p>
<p>The main translation page will now show just the language(s) you selected. 
For example, if you selected French, the following would appear within the main 
translation page:</p>
<p>
<img alt="screen 2" src="screen2.png" width="647" height="407" class="style1" /></p>
<h2>Translating text</h2>
<p>Click the name of the language to go to the translation page.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screen 3" src="screen3.png" width="716" height="588" class="style1" /></p>

<p>The translation page shows texts that need translation, in groups of 10. 
Click the magnifying glass to show a single text at a time.</p>
<p>If you wish to translate new text, you probably want to change the displayed 
items to &quot;untranslated items&quot; from &quot;all items&quot;. This will show only the texts 
that have not yet had a translation added. </p>
<p>For each text that needs to be translated, the English text is shown, and a 
place to type the new translation is provided. If the text has already been 
translated, the existing translation is also provided.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screen 4" src="screen4.png" width="684" height="124" class="style1" /></p>
<p>For each text that you wish to translate, enter the new translation. It is OK 
to leave a translation blank for someone else to look at if you are unsure.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t forget to click the &quot;Save and Continue&quot; button after entering 
your translations.</strong></p>

<h2>Special characters</h2>
<p>There are a few special characters that appear in the texts.</p>
<p>The &quot;&amp;&quot; character appears before letters that will become keyboard shortcuts 
in the program. For example, the name of the File menu is actually &quot;&amp;File&quot;, 
indicating that Alt+F can be used to open the file menu from the keyboard. 
Whenever you see the &amp;, place a corresponding ampersand before the character in 
the translated text that should be the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>The sequence &quot;{0}&quot; occurs in a few texts. When the program is run, this 
sequence is replaced with text that is computed by the program and may change. 
Place the same sequence of characters in the translated text, in a grammatically 
correct position.</p>
